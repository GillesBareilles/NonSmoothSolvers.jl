## NonSmoothSolvers

## NonSmoothPb interface

A non smooth problem is expected to implement the following interface.


## Notes
Method calls may be (roughly) timed using `TimerOutputs`. This functionality is turned on/off by calling `TimerOutputs.enable_debug_timings(StructuredSolvers)` and `TimerOutputs.disable_debug_timings(StructuredSolvers)`.
